# State Of Work

* Project has been fully configured from cookiecutter-django using MySQL.
* Deployed to production at [negligentoctopus.pythonanywhere.com](negligentoctopus.pythonanywhere.com).

Core models are being defined and added to the django-admin.
Account and Transactions have been implemented with balance as prefix-sum.

## Update


# Today

Theres currently an error due to creating some transactions using the shell. These transaction dont have a proper seconds in the timestamp, so calling save even if we have not cahnged the timestamps raises the error for changing timestamp. Because of this we have changed the implementations for balance to allow using the save arguments, such as force\_update. (Reimplement balance to allow save)
