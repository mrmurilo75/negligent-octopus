# Current State

See [[2024-03-06]] for previous log.

Deployed to production at [negligentoctopus.pythonanywhere.com](negligentoctopus.pythonanywhere.com).

Project has been fully configured from cookiecutter-django using MySQL. As development environment we are remotely accesing a linux system and using tmux and nvim, with the relevant plugins for code review.

Core models are being defined and added to the django-admin interface to be tested.

# Today

Define automatic balance tracking in account.

## Work Log
__InProgress__
* Use django's signal post-save to update accounts balance.

__ToDo__
* Migrate.
* Test on admin.

__Done__

__Discarded__
~~Define balance property, as well as relevant new db fields - assuming fields defined in Transaction. Define fields and functions in Transaction. Check FieldTracker in model\_utils.~~ This is overcomplicated. Strategy changed to above.

# To Do
[[Future Work]] Consider that it would be a high usability information to have current balance on each transaction. One possibility would be same as balance in account (We could send a event to account and use it as a manager). Another way would be doing it lazily from our current balance backwards (but this assumes end of timeframe is last transaction - which might not be true).
