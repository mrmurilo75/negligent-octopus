# State Of Work

* Project has been fully configured from cookiecutter-django using MySQL.
* Deployed to production at [negligentoctopus.pythonanywhere.com](negligentoctopus.pythonanywhere.com).

Core models are defined and added to the django-admin.
Account and Transactions have been implemented with balance as prefix-sum.
Transfers are implemented as coupled transactions.

We have implemented a ImportActivo model and admin, which processes on save and creates ImportedActivoTransactions. These can be validated by a checkbox and if so, will create a Transaction on save.
