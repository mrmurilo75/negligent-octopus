# Current State

See [[2024-03-06]] for previous log.

Deployed to production at [negligentoctopus.pythonanywhere.com](negligentoctopus.pythonanywhere.com).

Project has been fully configured from cookiecutter-django using MySQL.

Core models are being defined and added to the django-admin interface to be tested.

## Update

Account and transactions are implemented with balance as prefix-sum.

# Today

Define automatic balance tracking in account.

Prefix-sum: This requires a strict ordering. When adding, deleting or changing the amount: Just add it according to the ordering, then update balance on all transactions that follow. The problem here is that we'll change many transactions, so having such a big lock is not a good ideia, and without having a lock we might access a transaction before it is updated.
    - Strict Ordering: is implemented by standard on django model Meta.order\_by
