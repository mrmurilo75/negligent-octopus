# State Of Work

* Project has been fully configured from cookiecutter-django using MySQL.
* Deployed to production at [negligentoctopus.pythonanywhere.com](negligentoctopus.pythonanywhere.com).

Core models are defined and added to the django-admin.
Account and Transactions have been implemented with balance as prefix-sum.
Transfers are implemented as coupled transactions.

We have implemented a SimpleTransactionImport model and admin, which processes on save and creates SimpleImportedTransactions. These can be validated by a checkbox and if so, will create a Transaction on save.

Created a custom admin site to use as prototype, currently in phase preparation for alpha testing. Pages, for example list view, will be slowly redirect to main site as they are implemented.
Sign up on main site is fully functionational, with email confirmation.
