# To Do
[[Future Works]] Sharting an account with somebody else so that they can interact with it. We would have more information fields suchas who added the transaction. We can also share ontly for transafers, so you would make a transfer on your acc to someone elses acc. That persona can accept or reject and add their own info for it.
[[Future Works]] Change the updating of balance in transactions to be lazy, to avoid overloading server if someone does many transactions.
